            <span>Hi! I'm Kai, an aspiring data science student studying a Bachelor of Advanced Science (hopefully with honours) at Curtin University. 
                I am currently also working with Associate Professor Duc-Son "Sonny" Pham on research with computer vision and chest x-rays.
                In my spare time, I enjoy running, lifting, gaming, building gundams and hanging out with my girlfriend.</span>
